A.\nTI Anaplerotic Role for Cytosolic Malic Enzyme in Engineered Saccharomyces\n   cerevisiae Strains\nSO APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY\nVL 77\nIS 3\nBP 732\nEP 738\nDI 10.1128/AEM.02132-10\nPD FEB 2011\nPY 2011\nAB Malic enzyme catalyzes the reversible oxidative decarboxylation of\n   malate to pyruvate and CO(2). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae MAE1 gene\n   encodes a mitochondrial malic enzyme whose proposed physiological roles\n   are related to the oxidative, malate-decarboxylating reaction. Hitherto,\n   the inability of pyruvate carboxylase-negative (Pyc(-)) S. cerevisiae\n   strains to grow on glucose suggested that Mae1p cannot act as a\n   pyruvate-carboxylating, anaplerotic enzyme. In this study, relocation of\n   malic enzyme to the cytosol and creation of thermodynamically favorable\n   conditions for pyruvate carboxylation by metabolic engineering, process\n   design, and adaptive evolution, enabled malic enzyme to act as the sole\n   anaplerotic enzyme in S. cerevisiae. The Escherichia coli NADH-dependent\n   sfcA malic enzyme was expressed in a Pyc(-) S. cerevisiae background.\n   When PDC2, a transcriptional regulator of pyruvate decarboxylase genes,\n   was deleted to increase intracellular pyruvate levels and cells were\n   grown under a CO(2) atmosphere to favor carboxylation, adaptive\n   evolution yielded a strain that grew on glucose (specific growth rate,\n   0.06 +/- 0.01 h(-1)). Growth of the evolved strain was enabled by a\n   single point mutation (Asp336Gly) that switched the cofactor preference\n   of E. coli malic enzyme from NADH to NADPH. Consistently, cytosolic\n   relocalization of the native Mae1p, which can use both NADH and NADPH,\n   in a pyc1,2 Delta pdc2 Delta strain grown under a CO(2) atmosphere, also\n   enabled slow-growth on glucose. Although growth rates of these strains\n   are still low, the higher ATP efficiency of carboxylation via malic\n   enzyme, compared to the pyruvate carboxylase pathway, may contribute to\n   metabolic engineering of S. cerevisiae for anaerobic, high-yield\n   C(4)-dicarboxylic acid production.\nTC 0\nZ9 0\nSN 0099-2240\nUT WOS:000286597100004\nER\n\nPT J\nAU Zelle, Rintze M.\n   Trueheart, Josh\n   Harrison, Jacob C.\n   Pronk, Jack T.\n   van Maris, Antonius J. A.\nTI Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase as the Sole Anaplerotic Enzyme in\n   Saccharomyces cerevisiae\nSO APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY\nVL 76\nIS 16\nBP 5383\nEP 5389\nDI 10.1128/AEM.01077-10\nPD AUG 2010\nPY 2010\nAB Pyruvate carboxylase is the sole anaplerotic enzyme in glucose-grown\n   cultures of wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Pyruvate\n   carboxylase-negative (Pyc(-)) S. cerevisiae strains cannot grow on\n   glucose unless media are supplemented with C(4) compounds, such as\n   aspartic acid. In several succinate-producing prokaryotes,\n   phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) fulfills this anaplerotic\n   role. However, the S. cerevisiae PEPCK encoded by PCK1 is repressed by\n   glucose and is considered to have a purely decarboxylating and\n   gluconeogenic function. This study investigates whether and under which\n   conditions PEPCK can replace the anaplerotic function of pyruvate\n   carboxylase in S. cerevisiae. Pyc(-) S. cerevisiae strains\n   constitutively overexpressing the PEPCK either from S. cerevisiae or\n   from Actinobacillus succinogenes did not grow on glucose as the sole\n   carbon source. However, evolutionary engineering yielded mutants able to\n   grow on glucose as the sole carbon source at a maximum specific growth\n   rate of ca. 0.14 h(-1), one-half that of the (pyruvate\n   carboxylase-positive) reference strain grown under the same conditions.\n   Growth was dependent on high carbon dioxide concentrations, indicating\n   that the reaction catalyzed by PEPCK operates near thermodynamic\n   equilibrium. Analysis and reverse engineering of two independently\n   evolved strains showed that single point mutations in pyruvate kinase,\n   which competes with PEPCK for phosphoenolpyruvate, were sufficient to\n   enable the use of PEPCK as the sole anaplerotic enzyme. The PEPCK\n   reaction produces one ATP per carboxylation event, whereas the original\n   route through pyruvate kinase and pyruvate carboxylase is ATP neutral.\n   This increased ATP yield may prove crucial for engineering of efficient\n   and low-cost anaerobic production of C(4) dicarboxylic acids in S.\n   cerevisiae.\nTC 1\nZ9 1\nSN 0099-2240\nUT WOS:000280633400006\nER\n\nPT J\nAU Zelle, Rintze M.\n   De Hulster, Erik\n   Kloezen, Wendy\n   Pronk, Jack T.\n   van Maris, Antonius J. A.\nTI Key Process Conditions for Production of C(4) Dicarboxylic Acids in\n   Bioreactor Batch Cultures of an Engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n   Strain\nSO APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY\nVL 76\nIS 3\nBP 744\nEP 750\nDI 10.1128/AEM.02396-09\nPD FEB 2010\nPY 2010\nAB A recent effort to improve malic acid production by Saccharomyces\n   cerevisiae by means of metabolic engineering resulted in a strain that\n   produced up to 59 g liter(-1) of malate at a yield of 0.42 mol (mol\n   glucose)(-1) in calcium carbonate-buffered shake flask cultures. With\n   shake flasks, process parameters that are important for scaling up this\n   process cannot be controlled independently. In this study, growth and\n   product formation by the engineered strain were studied in bioreactors\n   in order to separately analyze the effects of pH, calcium, and carbon\n   dioxide and oxygen availability. A near-neutral pH, which in shake\n   flasks was achieved by adding CaCO(3), was required for efficient C(4)\n   dicarboxylic acid production. Increased calcium concentrations, a side\n   effect of CaCO(3) dissolution, had a small positive effect on malate\n   formation. Carbon dioxide enrichment of the sparging gas (up to 15%\n   [vol/vol]) improved production of both malate and succinate. At higher\n   concentrations, succinate titers further increased, reaching 0.29 mol\n   (mol glucose)(-1), whereas malate formation strongly decreased. Although\n   fully aerobic conditions could be achieved, it was found that moderate\n   oxygen limitation benefitted malate production. In conclusion, malic\n   acid production with the engineered S. cerevisiae strain could be\n   successfully transferred from shake flasks to 1-liter batch bioreactors\n   by simultaneous optimization of four process parameters (pH and\n   concentrations of CO(2), calcium, and O(2)). Under optimized conditions,\n   a malate yield of 0.48 +/- 0.01 mol (mol glucose)(-1) was obtained in\n   bioreactors, a 19% increase over yields in shake flask experiments.\nTC 2\nZ9 2\nSN 0099-2240\nUT WOS:000274017400015\nER\n\nPT J\nAU Abbott, Derek A.\n   Zelle, Rintze M.\n   Pronk, Jack T.\n   van Maris, Antonius J.

Microbial conversion of\n   renewable feedstocks has a huge potential for cleaner, sustainable\n   industrial production of fuels and chemicals. Microbial production of\n   organic acids is a promising approach for production of chemical\n   building blocks that can replace their petrochemically derived\n   equivalents. Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not naturally\n   produce organic acids in large quantities, its robustness, pH tolerance,\n   simple nutrient requirements and long history as an industrial workhorse\n   make it an excellent candidate biocatalyst for such processes. Genetic\n   engineering, along with evolution and selection, has been successfully\n   used to divert carbon from ethanol, the natural endproduct of S.\n   cerevisiae, to pyruvate. Further engineering, which included expression\n   of heterologous enzymes and transporters, yielded strains capable of\n   producing lactate and malate from pyruvate. Besides these metabolic\n   engineering strategies, this review discusses the impact of transport\n   and energetics as well as the tolerance towards these organic acids. In\n   addition to recent progress in engineering S. cerevisiae for organic\n   acid production, the key limitations and challenges are discussed in the\n   context of sustainable industrial production of organic acids from\n   renewable feedstocks.\nTC 11\nZ9 11\nSN 1567-1356\nUT WOS:000271264400001\nER\n\nPT J\nAU Zelle, Rintze M.\n   de Hulster, Erik\n   van Winden, WoUter A.\n   de Waard, Pieter\n   Dijkema, Cor\n   Winkler, Aaron A.\n   Geertman, Jan-Maarten A.\n   van Dijken, Johannes P.\n   Pronk, Jack T.\n   van Maris, Antonius J.

				"abstractNote": "Malic enzyme catalyzes the reversible oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate and CO(2). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae MAE1 gene encodes a mitochondrial malic enzyme whose proposed physiological roles are related to the oxidative, malate-decarboxylating reaction. Hitherto, the inability of pyruvate carboxylase-negative (Pyc(-)) S. cerevisiae strains to grow on glucose suggested that Mae1p cannot act as a pyruvate-carboxylating, anaplerotic enzyme. In this study, relocation of malic enzyme to the cytosol and creation of thermodynamically favorable conditions for pyruvate carboxylation by metabolic engineering, process design, and adaptive evolution, enabled malic enzyme to act as the sole anaplerotic enzyme in S. cerevisiae. The Escherichia coli NADH-dependent sfcA malic enzyme was expressed in a Pyc(-) S. cerevisiae background. When PDC2, a transcriptional regulator of pyruvate decarboxylase genes, was deleted to increase intracellular pyruvate levels and cells were grown under a CO(2) atmosphere to favor carboxylation, adaptive evolution yielded a strain that grew on glucose (specific growth rate, 0.06 +/- 0.01 h(-1)). Growth of the evolved strain was enabled by a single point mutation (Asp336Gly) that switched the cofactor preference of E. coli malic enzyme from NADH to NADPH. Consistently, cytosolic relocalization of the native Mae1p, which can use both NADH and NADPH, in a pyc1,2 Delta pdc2 Delta strain grown under a CO(2) atmosphere, also enabled slow-growth on glucose. Although growth rates of these strains are still low, the higher ATP efficiency of carboxylation via malic enzyme, compared to the pyruvate carboxylase pathway, may contribute to metabolic engineering of S. cerevisiae for anaerobic, high-yield C(4)-dicarboxylic acid production.",

				"abstractNote": "Pyruvate carboxylase is the sole anaplerotic enzyme in glucose-grown cultures of wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Pyruvate carboxylase-negative (Pyc(-)) S. cerevisiae strains cannot grow on glucose unless media are supplemented with C(4) compounds, such as aspartic acid. In several succinate-producing prokaryotes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) fulfills this anaplerotic role. However, the S. cerevisiae PEPCK encoded by PCK1 is repressed by glucose and is considered to have a purely decarboxylating and gluconeogenic function. This study investigates whether and under which conditions PEPCK can replace the anaplerotic function of pyruvate carboxylase in S. cerevisiae. Pyc(-) S. cerevisiae strains constitutively overexpressing the PEPCK either from S. cerevisiae or from Actinobacillus succinogenes did not grow on glucose as the sole carbon source. However, evolutionary engineering yielded mutants able to grow on glucose as the sole carbon source at a maximum specific growth rate of ca. 0.14 h(-1), one-half that of the (pyruvate carboxylase-positive) reference strain grown under the same conditions. Growth was dependent on high carbon dioxide concentrations, indicating that the reaction catalyzed by PEPCK operates near thermodynamic equilibrium. Analysis and reverse engineering of two independently evolved strains showed that single point mutations in pyruvate kinase, which competes with PEPCK for phosphoenolpyruvate, were sufficient to enable the use of PEPCK as the sole anaplerotic enzyme. The PEPCK reaction produces one ATP per carboxylation event, whereas the original route through pyruvate kinase and pyruvate carboxylase is ATP neutral. This increased ATP yield may prove crucial for engineering of efficient and low-cost anaerobic production of C(4) dicarboxylic acids in S. cerevisiae.",

				"abstractNote": "A recent effort to improve malic acid production by Saccharomyces cerevisiae by means of metabolic engineering resulted in a strain that produced up to 59 g liter(-1) of malate at a yield of 0.42 mol (mol glucose)(-1) in calcium carbonate-buffered shake flask cultures. With shake flasks, process parameters that are important for scaling up this process cannot be controlled independently. In this study, growth and product formation by the engineered strain were studied in bioreactors in order to separately analyze the effects of pH, calcium, and carbon dioxide and oxygen availability. A near-neutral pH, which in shake flasks was achieved by adding CaCO(3), was required for efficient C(4) dicarboxylic acid production. Increased calcium concentrations, a side effect of CaCO(3) dissolution, had a small positive effect on malate formation. Carbon dioxide enrichment of the sparging gas (up to 15% [vol/vol]) improved production of both malate and succinate. At higher concentrations, succinate titers further increased, reaching 0.29 mol (mol glucose)(-1), whereas malate formation strongly decreased. Although fully aerobic conditions could be achieved, it was found that moderate oxygen limitation benefitted malate production. In conclusion, malic acid production with the engineered S. cerevisiae strain could be successfully transferred from shake flasks to 1-liter batch bioreactors by simultaneous optimization of four process parameters (pH and concentrations of CO(2), calcium, and O(2)). Under optimized conditions, a malate yield of 0.48 +/- 0.01 mol (mol glucose)(-1) was obtained in bioreactors, a 19% increase over yields in shake flask experiments.",

Few opportunities for prevention have been identified; therefore, public health approaches to prematurity include assurance of delivery in a facility capable of managing neonatal complications, quality improvement to minimize interinstitutional variations, early developmental support for such infants, and attention to related family health issues.",
